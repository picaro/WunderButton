# WunderButton

Android application, that add functionality to WunderList
You could have tablets in the Kitchen and WC with open app , that will show list of common products tu buy.

For example in toilet I setup buttons - Toilet Paper, Washing Powder, Tooth Paste
so in one click i add necessary item to my shop-list.

it's could be like Amazon button , but a bit simpler.
